	RESULTS
	{
		default = You recorded the remote state of the situation.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Time to take-off, sir, it's the runway.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = That's the Kerbal Space Center. Technically

		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Landing here would be very...Kerbal.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = It's dead here
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = We could land here...
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = If you land here we will get stuck in the sand.
