	RESULTS
	{
		default = You record the electronic state of the situation.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = What are you waiting to take-off?
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Congratulations, you landed back at the KSC with one landing gear and no more propellant.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands =  Do you really think it is the time to gather Science? Keep focused on control!
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Green, green, brown, green...Oh, wait!
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = It is a perfect moment to take a photo.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Can I fly enough high to not crash in these mountains?
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Desert. Temperature +75Â°K. I think my circuits are starting to overheat.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Landing here would be very...Kerbal.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = I think I prefer Desert heat.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = It's so white that the instruments are confused.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = If you land here we will get stuck in the sand.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = This cockpit is not made for water landings.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = Do we say blue or marine?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = We are space! Wait, wat is "Suborbital trajectoy"?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = I don't think this depressurization sound is normal.
		KerbinInSpace = I am floating in space...with empty monopropellant tanks...
		KerbinInSpace =
